        <h2>Is playing Heroes11 legal?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yes, it is absolutely safe! Heroes11 is a game of “skill”. The
          relevant law in India is absolutely clear that, unlike games of
          "chance", games which substantially require a player to apply his
          skill are absolutely legal.
          <p>
            <br />
            All games hosted by Heroes11 are carefully designed and the
            jurisdiction of prize winners is strictly monitored to ensure legal
            compliance with relevant laws currently in force in India.

            If you are accessing this site from Andhra Pradesh, Assam,
            Telangana, Sikkim or Nagaland, we hope you will enjoy our practice
            contests. However, the law in these states is unclear on playing
            games of skill with entry fees for cash prizes. You are therefore
            prohibited from playing cash contests on Heroes11 from any of these
            states. For additional information, please contact us at
            support@Heroes11.in.
